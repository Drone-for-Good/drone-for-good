Drones For Good connects scientists in need of drone data with pilots interested in donating their time and equipment.

Piloting a drone is difficult to learn and costly, which makes the barrier of entry high for scientists even though they stand to benefit greatly from the new technology. But record-breaking numbers of drones sold to amateur pilots growing each year, there is an army of pilots who are often looking for ways to use their tools and gain experience.

By linking up these two communities, Drone For Good, LLC is helping scientists stay focused on what they do best while amateur pilots
are provided with opportunities to get involved with real-life projects.

"Without Drone For Good, there's no way I could have gotten rainforest deforestation video every week for the past year," said researcher Jane Goodall. "My university doesn't have the funds and, besides, I'm not very coordinated."

Getting started on droneforgood.org is only a two-step operation for both scientists and pilots. Scientists place a pin on a map anywhere in the world, add a paragraph described their project and an expiration date. Pilots look for projects nearby them or where they plan to visit, then get in touch with the researcher who posted the project.

"Getting involved was super easy and helped build my portfolio," said pilot Sully Davis. "I get an alert when a project is within 50 miles of me. It's fun and gives me a good opportunity to help others."

Pilots and scientists should visit www.droneforgood.org.
