  <p>Flying a drone without causing harm is difficult even for expert pilots. This makes the barrier of entry high for those who stand to benefit greatly from the new technology.</p>
  <p>As the number of drones sold to amateur pilots grows, there is an army of pilots looking for ways to use their tools and gain experience.</p>
  <p>Drones For Good connects these pilots with scientists, journalists, artists and anyone else in need of drone data.</p>
  <p>Getting started is a simple, easy process. Users place a pin anywhere on the main map and provide a brief description of their project. Pilots look for projects nearby them or where they plan to visit, then get in touch with the user.</p>
  <p>By linking up these two communities, Drone For Good helps users stay focused on what they do best and enables amateur pilots to become involved with real-life projects.</p>
