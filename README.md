# drone-for-good

Drone for Good is a project that connects amatuer drone pilots to people seeking the use of drones in their projects (from scientific surveys to large-scale art projects). The PRESS-RELEASE contains more information regarding the motivations behind creating the project. It is currently deployed via Heroku, and can be found at: [drones-for-good.herokuapp.com](http://drones-for-good.herokuapp.com).

This project uses an Angular front-end, an Express server, and a Mongo database. All dependencies can be found in the package.json file, and the bower.json file. The drone no-fly zones were incorporated to the map display using geoJSON taken from Mapbox.

The authors of the project are: Alex Liotta, Kristin Mayer, Matt Loftus, and Tad Whitaker.
